# Performance Tuning {{{

# Delay (in milliseconds) between screen updates. Decreasing it,
# increases frames-per-second (FPS) at the cost of more CPU usage.
# The default value yields ~100 FPS which is more than sufficient for
# most uses. Note that to actually achieve 100 FPS you have to either
# set sync_to_monitor to no or use a monitor with a high refresh
# rate. Also, to minimize latency when there is pending input to be
# processed, repaint_delay is ignored.
repaint_delay 10

# Delay (in milliseconds) before input from the program running in
# the terminal is processed. Note that decreasing it will increase
# responsiveness, but also increase CPU usage and might cause flicker
# in full screen programs that redraw the entire screen on each loop,
# because kitty is so fast that partial screen updates will be drawn.
input_delay 3

# Sync screen updates to the refresh rate of the monitor. This
# prevents tearing (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_tearing)
# when scrolling. However, it limits the rendering speed to the
# refresh rate of your monitor. With a very high speed mouse/high
# keyboard repeat rate, you may notice some slight input latency.
# If so, set this to no.
sync_to_monitor yes

# }}}

# Miscellaneous {{{

# The value of the TERM environment variable to set
term xterm-kitty

# Allow other programs to control kitty. If you turn this on other
# programs can control all aspects of kitty, including sending text
# to kitty windows, opening new windows, closing windows, reading the
# content of windows, etc. Note that this even works over ssh
# connections.
allow_remote_control yes
